			<h3>Deficiencies of the activity</h3>
 			<p>Weeks ago, we had a special month which is called spirit month. In that month, we were arranged an activity every week. All of those intriguing activities includes unfreezing a frozen T-shirt and helping a classmate put it on, mannequin challenge, crazy hat day and carpool Karaoke. For each activity, we could obtain a score and bonus points if we accomplish the specific requirement. However, we noticed that students did nott have sufficient passion to participate. There are even some students rejecting to join because they think these are meaningless activities which distract our normal studying. For example, only two 10.5 students took part in the Carpool Karaokes activity while others consider it to be insignificant.</p>

        	<h3>The importance of Spirit Month</h3>
        	<p>The Spirit Month promote our team spirit and many things should be done by us as a team since all those activities need cooperation. It can also help us relieve our pressure and relax ourselves after intense study.</p>

        	<h3>Analysis of the deficiencies</h3>
        	<p class="content">
        		What we should know about is that the spirit month itself is obviously meaningful. Yet we only realize this long after it ends. We think that the reason why people are lack of passion is on the person who assign the work Mr. A. As in the last semester, he always assigned some interesting but kind of silly homework for us to do. Such as learning to have basic chat using another language; learn some dances and perform it in front of a lot of people. And he has a high standard so that we rarely obtain a high grade. The way he talks is also a reason of our feelings of him. For our group (Martin, Fred, Billy, Jay, Devin, Tina, Lily, Angel, Angelina) of that dancing activity, we had a drum which makes a big sound.

        	<p class="content">
        		After our performance, we heard that some 11th graders were giving us 1 and 0 points because we somehow disturbed them when we are practicing. And Mr. A told us it was not his business; we must go talk to those 11th graders by ourselves. However, our scores were not that bad, and we did not see any extreme low scores. Therefore Mr. A must has handled this issue, but he did not say it. His words are not very pleasant to hear all the time. And we often do not know what he actually does. These make most student do not like him so much because they don not know Mr. A completely although he is actually an adorable person.

        	<h3>Our solution</h3>
        	<p class="content">
     			Thus, we want to show all the teachers and student that our improved project which could both attract students attention as well as achieve the purpose to make everyone feel themselves live in a group. Our new spirit month would still be planed or organized by Mr. A since he always has awesome ideas, but the person who host all the activities could be another teacher who is more formal than Mr. A.
        	</p>
        	<p class="content">
        		Being hosted by a more serious teacher such as Mr. Alex, students will all consider the spirit month as a formal series of meaningful activities which requires great coordination and organizing abilities among students and teachers as a whole.

        <section class="paragraph" id="Outcome">
      		<h3>Outcome of our solution</h3>
      		<p>
      			The outcome of our solution can be judged and proved by former experiences. In the last semester, Mr. A taught class 1-3 and Mr. Alex taught class 4-6 WCG class. During all the class activities, all class 4-6 students complete the activities seriously and got a good score. Being led by a more formal teacher, the activities all go on well. Therefore, we believe that our solution will realize and improve the Sprit month.
      		</p>
        </section>
        <div class=boxfixed>In summary, the spirit month activity was led by Mr. A and did not went on very well as many students were not passionate to take part in the activities. Therefore, our solution is to let a more formal teacher lead the series of activities and we will have better outcomes.</div>
